# General Purpose

This repository is designed to be a collaborative working space for creating components for Leptos and Dioxus.

It's only a temporary repository to test and develop components. Once they are ready, they are integrated directly into [Rust UI](https://rust-ui-jp7dt.ondigitalocean.app/) (temporary URL).



# ðŸ‘‰ TODOS

You'll find the todos in the **Issues** tab. Thanks Florian for the idea :)



# ðŸ‘¾ Discord

I'll soon create a Discord server to discuss about the components and the project, and Rust over all (job opportunities, etc).

When it's ready I'll share the link here.
