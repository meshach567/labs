# General Purpose

This repository is designed to be a collaborative working space for creating components for Leptos and Dioxus.

It's only a temporary repository to test and develop components. Once they are ready, they are integrated directly into http://rust-ui.com/ (frequent updates so might not be available at all times).



# 👉 Process to Follow

You have all the infos with the video, but you can also refer to this 👇

## 1. In `👉-TODO-*` folder

1. Go to any folder with `👉-TODO-*`.
2. Select a project you like (open the index.html file with the VS Code extension `Live Server`).
3. Create a `component-name` branch.
└──>  ⚠️ Check if a branch was not created yet.
4. Use `Tailwind CSS` instead of plain CSS when it's possible (we use Tailwind CSS for Rust UI).
5. When it's done, move the project in `✔️✔️✔️✔️-DONE-✔️✔️✔️✔️` folder 📂.
   

## 2. In `1-LEPTOS-UI-LABS` or `2-DIOXUS-UI-LABS` folder

1. Add the component to `src/__demos__/` folder 📂.
2. Use the component in `shared/page_all_demos.rs` file.
