# General Purpose

This repository is designed to be a collaborative working space for creating components for Leptos and Dioxus.

It's only a temporary repository to test and develop components. Once they are ready, they are integrated directly into [Rust UI](https://rust-ui.com/).


# Installation

Please refer to [Leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos?tab=readme-ov-file#nightly-note/) or [Dioxus](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus?tab=readme-ov-file#running-the-examples) documentation.


Don't forget to :
- `rustup update`
- `cargo install-update -a`
- `cargo update`
  
- `git pull`



# ðŸ‘‰ TODOS

You'll find the todos in the **Issues** tab. Thanks Florian for the idea :)



# ðŸ‘¾ Discord

I'll soon create a Discord server to discuss about the components and the project, and Rust over all (job opportunities, etc).

When it's ready I'll share the link here.
